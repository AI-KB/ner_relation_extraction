# Information Extraction using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction
We may need to extract different information from texts. If such information is span based i.e the information can be represented in spans then Named Entity Recognition (NER) and relation extraction are very appropriate. 

## Named Entity Recognition(NER)
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to identify and extract important information from unstructured text. NER involves identifying entities such as people, organizations, locations, and other named objects in the text and classifying them into predefined categories. This technique is used in a wide range of applications, such as information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and question-answering systems.

NER works by using machine learning algorithms to analyze text and identify patterns that correspond to named entities. The algorithms use a variety of features, such as word frequency, part-of-speech tags, and contextual information to determine the likelihood that a given word or phrase is a named entity. Once the named entities are identified, they can be classified into pre-defined categories, such as person, organization, or location.

NER is a complex task that requires sophisticated algorithms and large amounts of training data. However, it can be an incredibly powerful tool for information extraction, allowing users to quickly and efficiently extract key information from large volumes of text. As NLP technology continues to improve, NER is likely to become an even more important technique for a wide range of applications, from business intelligence to social media analysis.

## Relation Extraction
Relation extraction is a key task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and extracting the relationships between entities in a given text. Entities can be anything from people, organizations, or locations to more abstract concepts like events, emotions, or opinions. The goal of relation extraction is to automatically identify the types of relationships that exist between entities in a text, such as whether one entity is a parent or spouse of another, whether they work for the same company or are related in some other way. This task is crucial for many NLP applications, such as question answering, information retrieval, and text summarization. Relation extraction algorithms typically use a combination of linguistic features, machine learning techniques, and knowledge bases to identify and classify relationships between entities. With the increasing volume of text data available, relation extraction is becoming more important than ever for extracting valuable insights from unstructured data.
